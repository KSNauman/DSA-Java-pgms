Implementation of Arraylist 
How Dynamic??
so imagine an array there you allocate a size so when the size limit is reached it over 
but in Arraylist its not the way but Alike the same 
it allocate a specific size when it is filled it copies to differnet array with a larger size than before this might be x1 , x0.5 , x2 depends on versions
typically it is x1.5 (10 -> 15)
