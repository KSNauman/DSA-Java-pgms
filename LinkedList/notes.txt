finding mid important point:
    When using the slow-fast pointer approach to find the middle of a singly linked list, the way we initialize the fast pointer determines whether we get:

    The first node of the second half (when even number of nodes) → Initialize fast = head
    The last node of the first half (when even number of nodes) → Initialize fast = head.next
